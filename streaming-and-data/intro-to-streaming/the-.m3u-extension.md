# ðŸ“ƒ The .M3U Extension

### Understand what the `.M3U` extension is.

{% hint style="info" %}
**M3U** (_MP3 URL_[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#cite\_note-WinPlay3v20-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#cite\_note-Gnomie-2) or [Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG\_Audio\_Layer\_3) [Uniform Resource Locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform\_Resource\_Locator)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#cite\_note-3) in full) is a computer file format for a multimedia [playlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist). One common use of the M3U file format is creating a single-entry playlist file pointing to a [stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming\_media) on the Internet. The created file provides easy access to that stream and is often used in downloads from a website, for emailing, and for listening to [Internet radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_radio).

Although originally designed for audio files, such as [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3), it is commonly used to point media players to audio and video sources, including online sources. M3U was originally developed by [Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer\_Society) for use with their [Winplay3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winplay3) software,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#cite\_note-4) but numerous media players and software applications now support the format.

### Simple explanation. <mark style="color:yellow;">(Self-written)</mark>

So, the `.M3U` format basically hosts a URL or multiple URLs of an audio stream or of mp3 files. \
You can extract this URL to play/stream the audio in MP3 format. It is as per Wikipedia, only a [de-facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_facto) standard and does not have any formal specification.
