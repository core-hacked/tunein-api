# â†” Requests & Responses

### Methods of making requests

Sadly, TuneIn has a [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy), that forbids you to access the API via JavaScript.\
However, you are still able to make requests using [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or other such software. This means that you can use PHP and its command execution functions to have a fully web-based radio streaming experience (although server-sided) or a custom software client/app.

All requests are made to the Base-URI defined in the [Introdcution](../README.md) section, with the endpoints respective
path appended and HTTP method specified before the path.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that the endpoint information may be incomplete or incorrect.
{% endhint %}

### Authentication & Security

Although they have used a same-origin policy, they did not implement any authentication which means you can get started right away.&#x20;

You need to specify the protocol that you want to use (<mark style="color:red;">HTTP</mark>/ <mark style="color:green;">HTTPS</mark>) since there is no automatic redirection to https even if you/the client can fully support an https connection.

```batch
http://opml.radiotime.com | not secure by default.
https://opml.radiotime.com | secure and encrypted.
```

An example request using curl could look like the following:

```bash
# Docs: GET /endpoint.ashx
curl -s -X GET "https://opml.radiotime.com/endpoint.ashx"
```

{% endcode %}

### API Responses

The API always responds with an XML Document which usually looks something like this if you made a valid request.

{% code title="Response (valid request)" %}

```xml
<opml version="1">
    <head>
        <title>Some Title</title>
        <status>200</status>
    </head>
    <body>
        <outline type="audio" text="OctoStation" URL="http://opml.radiotime.com/Tune.ashx?id=a12345" bitrate="128" reliability="99" guide_id="s45087" subtext="OctoStation" genre_id="g61" formats="mp3" item="station" image="http://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/a12345/images/logoq.png" now_playing_id="a12345" preset_id="a12345"/>
    </body>
</opml>
```

{% endcode %}

{% code title="Response (invalid request)" %}

```xml
<opml version="1">
    <head>
        <title>Invalid method</title>
        <status>404</status>
        <fault>Invalid method</fault>
        <fault_code>api.methodNotFound</fault_code>
    </head>
    <body> </body>
</opml>
```

{% endcode %}

### Alternative responses

Alternatively, you can add `&render=json` to the end of the request and render it in the json format. By default you will get an XML document.

{% code title="Response (valid request)" %}

```json
{
  "head": { "title": "Some title", "status": "200" },
  "body": [
    {
      "element": "outline",
      "type": "audio",
      "text": "OctoStation",
      "URL": "http://opml.radiotime.com/Tune.ashx?id=a12345",
      "bitrate": "128",
      "reliability": "99",
      "guide_id": "a12345",
      "subtext": "OctoStation",
      "genre_id": "g61",
      "formats": "mp3",
      "item": "station",
      "image": "http://cdn-profiles.tunein.com/a12345/images/logoq.png",
      "now_playing_id": "a12345",
      "preset_id": "a12345"
    }
  ]
}
```

{% endcode %}

{% code title="Response (invalid request)" %}

```json
{
  "head": {
    "title": "Invalid method",
    "status": "404",
    "fault": "Invalid method",
    "fault_code": "api.methodNotFound"
  },
  "body": []
}
```

{% endcode %}
